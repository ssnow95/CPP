My FLAT.
We live in a FLAT. Our FLAT is not very big. It is very clean and comfortable. There are two rooms in our FLAT.
There is also a kitchen and a bathroom. In the living-room there is a sofa, a TV, a bookcase, a coffee table, and two armchairs.
In my room there is a bed, a desk, a wardrobe, and a shelf. I love my FLAT very much.
